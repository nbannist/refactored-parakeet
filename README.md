# refactored-parakeet

Just a test repo for trying out pulling in react components from a repo with git.

## Installation

From the root of the project, run the following: 

`$ yarn`
 
This will install all dependencies.

## Scripts

### yarn run test

This script runs the tests for the components. This way, you are writing tests for the components in one place.

### yarn run build

This is to build all the components into one file transpiled into ES5.
    
## Usage

TBW (to be written) gotta test first...
